# F1-SAO-PAULO-2025-SQL-PROJECT
A MYSQL-based project analysing and exploring the F1 Sao Paulo Grand Prix results 

The dataset was created to examine a real-world motorsport scenario, pointing out driver performance, team comparisons, pit stop strategy, and race outcomes. The project i have created shows a clean schema design, analytical querying, and obtaining important insights from raw race data.

Key analyses include:
Driver skill and performance
The comparison of Teamates within that race
The use of Window Functions to differentiate Time Gap
How Pit Stops affect Team position and overrall performance
The Labelling of Drivers that did not finish (DNFs)

SQL skills shown:
Schema Design and the creation of a table
Data insertion, the evolution of the Schema with updates
Data Aggregation With GROUP BY analysis
Race Gap Calculations determined by Window Functions
Derived metrics and safe handling of edge cases
Filtering and ordering for analytical insights

This Project that i have created is a portfolio showcasing the use of SQL in a real world scenerio with the ability to include Power Bi storytelling.
